# 9-Bit_UART_Module
# What is UART?
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
(UART) is widely used in data communication process especially
for its advantages of high reliability, long distance and low cost.

# Improved UART design?
The design features automatic address
identification in the character itself. I have implemented the
VLSI design of the module and pass data between the proposed
9-bit UART module with a host CPU. The design consists of
receiver module, transmitter module, and
synchronous FIFOs.
